I'm between these two ideas...


1)  Travel blog


Users can post different articles and information about their favorite vacation locations, 
site seeing spots, etc.  They can add pictures to their posts as well as links to other
webpages.  For example, a user talking about their favorite restuarants in Manhattan could
add links to the restaurants' websites.


2)  Photography/Art blog

Users can post their favorite and most recent work (in the form of pictures and captions).  
They can write articles relating to photography and art.  Users can also link within their posts 
the materials/equipment/technique they used (camera equipment, paint brushes, paint, medium, etc.)
